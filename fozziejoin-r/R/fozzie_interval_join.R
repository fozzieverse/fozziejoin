#' Perform a fuzzy join between two data frames using interval overlap matching.
#'
#' `fozzie_interval_join()` and its directional variants (`fozzie_interval_inner_join()`, `fozzie_interval_left_join()`, etc.)
#' enable approximate matching of interval columns in two data frames based on overlap logic.
#' These joins are conceptually similar to `data.table::foverlaps()` and Bioconductor's `IRanges::findOverlaps()`, supporting both continuous and discrete interval semantics.
#'
#' @param df1 A data frame to join from (left table).
#' @param df2 A data frame to join to (right table).
#' @param by A named list mapping left and right interval columns. Must contain two entries: start and end.
#' @param how A string specifying the join mode. One of:
#'   - `"inner"`: matched pairs only.
#'   - `"left"`: all rows from `df1`, unmatched rows filled with NAs.
#'   - `"right"`: all rows from `df2`, unmatched rows filled with NAs.
#'   - `"full"`: all rows from both `df1` and `df2`.
#'   - `"anti"`: rows from `df1` not matched in `df2`.
#'   - `"semi"`: rows from `df1` that matched with one or more matches in `df2`.
#' @param overlap_type A string specifying the overlap logic. One of:
#'   - `"any"`: any overlap.
#'   - `"within"`: left interval fully within right.
#'   - `"start"`: left start within right.
#'   - `"end"`: left end within right.
#' @param maxgap Maximum allowed gap between intervals (non-negative).
#' @param minoverlap Minimum required overlap length (non-negative).
#' @param interval_mode A string specifying how interval boundaries should be interpreted. One of:
#'   - `"auto"`: automatically infer mode based on column types.
#'   - `"real"`: treat interval boundaries as continuous numeric values (e.g., `double`). Overlaps are computed using strict inequality and floating-point arithmetic.
#'   - `"integer"`: treat interval boundaries as discrete integer ranges. This mode behaves similarly to Bioconductor's `IRanges` â€” intervals are inclusive and defined over integer coordinates, so `[start, end]` includes both endpoints. This affects how overlaps, gaps, and minimum overlap lengths are calculated, especially when `maxgap` or `minoverlap` are used.
#' @param nthread Optional integer specifying the number of threads to use for
#'        parallelization. If not provided, the value is determined by 
#'        `options("fozzie.nthread")`. The package default is inherited from
#'        Rayon, the multithreading library used throughout the package.
#'
#' @return A data frame with approximately matched rows depending on the join type.
#'
#' @examples
#' df1 <- data.frame(start = c(1, 5), end = c(3, 7))
#' df2 <- data.frame(start = c(2, 6), end = c(4, 8))
#'
#' fozzie_interval_inner_join(df1, df2, by = c(start = "start", end = "end"), overlap_type = "any")
#' @note
#' When `interval_mode = "real"`, interval boundaries are treated as continuous values and matched using floating-point arithmetic.
#' Due to precision limitations, a small threshold (typically around `1e-6`) is internally added to the query range to ensure adjacent or near-touching intervals are considered for matching.
#' This is especially relevant for timestamp-based joins, where intervals like `[14:00:00, 14:00:01]` and `[13:00:00, 14:00:00]` may fail to match unless a sufficient `maxgap` or internal epsilon is applied.
