}
\arguments{
\item{df1}{A data frame to join from (left table).}

\item{df2}{A data frame to join to (right table).}

\item{by}{A named list or character vector indicating the matching columns. Can be a character vector of length 2, e.g. \code{c("col1", "col2")},
or a named list like \code{list(col1 = "col2")}.}

\item{how}{A string specifying the join mode. One of:
\itemize{
\item \code{"inner"}: matched pairs only.
\item \code{"left"}: all rows from \code{df1}, unmatched rows filled with NAs.
\item \code{"right"}: all rows from \code{df2}, unmatched rows filled with NAs.
\item \code{"full"}: all rows from both \code{df1} and \code{df2}.
\item \code{"anti"}: rows from \code{df1} not matched in \code{df2}.
\item \code{"semi"}: rows from \code{df1} that matched with one or more matches in \code{df2}.
}}

\item{max_distance}{A numeric threshold for allowable absolute difference between values (lower is stricter).}

\item{distance_col}{Optional name of column to store computed differences.}

\item{nthread}{Optional integer specifying the number of threads to use for
parallelization. If not provided, the value is determined by
\code{options("fozzie.nthread")}. The package default is inherited from
Rayon, the multithreading library used throughout the package.}
}
\value{
A data frame with approximately matched rows depending on the join type. See individual functions like \code{fozzie_difference_inner_join()} for examples.
If \code{distance_col} is specified, an additional numeric column is included.
}
\description{
\code{fozzie_difference_join()} and its directional variants (\code{fozzie_difference_inner_join()}, \code{fozzie_difference_left_join()}, \code{fozzie_difference_right_join()}, \code{fozzie_difference_anti_join()}, \code{fozzie_difference_full_join()})
enable approximate matching of numeric fields in two data frames based on absolute difference thresholds.
These joins are analogous to \code{fuzzyjoin::difference_join}, but implemented in Rust for performance.

\examples{
df1 <- data.frame(x = c(1.0, 2.0, 3.0))
df2 <- data.frame(x = c(1.05, 2.1, 2.95))

fozzie_difference_left_join(df1, df2, by = c("x"), max_distance = 0.2)
